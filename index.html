        <p>Down Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that is present from the earliest stages of an individual's development, stemming from chromosome 21. 
            Down Syndrome wasn’t officially recognized until 1866, when John Langdon Down coined a term for the condition - “Mongolism”. It wasn’t until the early 1970’s 
            that “Down Syndrome” became the accepted term for the condition. Due to people with Down Syndrome being institutionalized all over the world in the past (more about this
            in 'THE FUTURE'), 
            it took a long time for the quality of life of those with Down Syndrome to be where it is today (Down Syndrome, 2018). The aim of this website is to 
            continue spreading awareness about those with Down Syndrome, to further support a world where people with Down Syndrome can thrive similar to the way that other 
            people are able to live.
