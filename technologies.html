        <h2>2 TECHNOLOGIES FOR DOWN SYNDROME</h2>
        <h3>Monitoring - Echocardiogram:</h3>
        <img class="echo-patient-image"src="Images/Echocardiogram-Patient.jpg" alt="Image of an echocardiogram being used on a patient">
        <p>
            50% of babies with Down Syndrome are born with CHD:
        </p>
        <p>
            CHD - Congenital Heart Disease; High blood pressure in the lungs, blue-tinted skin from limited 
            oxygen in the bloodstream, and the heart cannot efficiently pump blood (What Conditions, 2021). For those
            born with CHD, echocardiograms are often used to monitor their hearts (Echocardiogram, n.d.).
        </p>

        <h4>PROCEDURE: (Echocardiogram, n.d.)</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Transducer - A wand-shaped device encoded in gel - The transducer is spread onto the patients chest.</li>
            <li>The transducer sends high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to the heart.</li>
            <li>The heart echoes the high-frequency sound waves, which are then recorded by the transducer.</li>
            <li>The transducer records the echoes from the heart, and a computer is used to convert the sounds into moving images.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note that an echocardiogram makes it very easy to track blood flow, and if the patient has CHD, the blood flow would be blocked or significantly slower in the monitored valve. This is an obvious indicator, which is why
            an echocardiogram can be used to monitor the patient's symptoms, if they have Down Syndrome and need to be closely monitored. (Echocardiogram, n.d.).

        <h3>Diagnosis - Karyotypes:</h3>

        <img class="kar2-image" src="Images/Karyotype.jpg" alt="Karyotype of someone with Down Syndrome">

        <p>
            Karyotyping involves drawing a blood sample from the baby to examine their blood cells, photographing the chromosomes to detect trisomy 21. This can 
            either be done prenatally, or after birth to confirm a diagnosis (What is Down Syndrome?, 2021).
        </p>
        <h4>2 POSSIBLE PRENATAL TEST METHODS: (Bhargava, 2020)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) - A long needle is used to draw a sample of the babyâ€™s cells from tissues in the placenta, which feeds the baby 
                during pregnancy.
            </li>
            <li>Amniocentesis - A long needle is used to draw amniotic fluid (liquid that coats the baby in the womb), which can be karyotyped.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            After observing the karyotype and ordering the chromosome sets from 1 - 23, the doctor would see an extra chromosome in set 21, or at least partial copy 
            if the baby has Down Syndrome(Bhargava, 2020). Note that 1/100 of women who get either one of these tests have a miscarriage (Bhargava, 2020).
