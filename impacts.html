        <h2>IMPACT ON EVERYDAY LIFE - 2 ACTIVITIES THAT CHILDREN MAY NEED ACCOMODATIONS FOR</h2>
        <h3>School</h3>

        <p>
            Most children with down syndrome are born with moderate cognitive impairment, affecting both short and long-term memory (Down Syndrome, 2018). Furthermore, their 
            language development is often delayed, causing them to enrol to school at a different age (Down Syndrome, 2018). With memory-impairments, they wouldn’t be 
            able to retain information at the same rate that others do. They may struggle to finish tests in the allotted time without accommodations, and they may struggle 
            with reading & writing, as their active recall may not be at the same level as other students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some learners use a different program - Attend special schools where they are taught a curriculum with an adapted pace and content. Others may 
            feel that they need to follow a self-paced schedule, and learn at home (Cicerchia, 2020). However, many students decide to join a regular class, alongside Down 
            Syndrome-free classmates. This has been found to enhance a sense of independence, and improve social skills. This will mean that the student will still need 
            certain accommodations, such as extended time limits, lower word count expectations, and supplementary time with a teaching assistant. This is offered in Ontario through an Individual Pathways Plan (IPP) (Cicerchia, 2020).

        <h3>Eating</h3>
        <p>
            Down Syndrome involves the abnormal development of certain organs, including digestive organs, due to the presence of trisomy 21 in each cell. Digestive organs 
            that develop abnormally can result in digestive problems such as GI blockage or heartburn. The risk of <em>celiac disease</em> in particular is quite common 
            (Down Syndrome, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
            The implications of digestive issues can be quite complicated. For example, with celiac disease, there is a strict autoimmune response to gluten, and it must 
            be avoided - This really limits the choices of what the individual can eat, and common activities (such as eating at school events, going to restaurants) must 
            be avoided. This can be accommodated for by the parents, by finding celiac-friendly restaurants and groceries. Having labels that indicate gluten-free really 
            help for those with Down Syndrome and celiac disease.
